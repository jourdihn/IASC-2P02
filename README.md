Of all the things I was expecting to wake up to, this was not it; A call request from Beth sat on the screen of my pager amongst the myriad of other notifications.
This was from a while ago, how long has she been waiting? 

I rushed to get myself out of bed and to a phone, any phone that I could use to call Beth. Unfortunately, my phone currently sat broken in the kitchen, which meant that I was going to have to get to a call centre fast if I was going to have a hope in hell in catching her before she left for work. If only I had gotten it fixed sooner.

I picked up yesterday’s outfit, it didn’t matter what I was wearing at the moment, I just needed to get out the door as soon as possible. Thankfully my bag was still packed from when I got home yesterday and dropped by the door. That saved me from having to look for it on my way out. 

This Saturday morning air bit at the skin on my palms as I stepped out the door and started along my usual path towards my neighbourhood’s local call centre. As I approached the pedestrian path that would normally take me right to the block that I needed, a construction barrier stood in my way. 

A burly man approached dressed in a hard hat and reflective vest, “Sorry, but the path is blocked off for now, a pipe burst last night so we’ve got to dig the whole thing up.”

Now, this was not the best news. But I could handle it. I just needed to go up two blocks then right? 

No that can’t be it. Maybe it was up then left then right? 

Crap, I really wish I had one of those portable GPS’ right now. 

There didn’t seem to be any bus station maps that I could use to orient myself, and the construction worker that I spoke with earlier has since disappeared behind the caution tape, so it was up to me to find a passerby that was willing to help. 

As I looked around, an older woman — perhaps in her late sixties — sat on a nearby bench reading a book. She seemed friendly enough. 

“Excuse me ma’am, do you know how I could get to the Willoughby Call Centre? I’m a little new to the area and the pedestrian path is closed off. I’m kinda lost without it.” 

“The path is closed off? Well that’s certainly a shame. Come, follow me.” The lady snapped her book shut and stood from her spot on the bench, “I’ll walk with you, I’ve been meaning to make a call to my son.” 

We both started towards the direction of the elusive call centre. The lady, who who like to be called, Candy had a son who lived in the city over, working on some new technology that allows you to use the internet to talk to people instantaneously. She says that her son thinks the technology could also be used to make telephones portable, but that whole idea sounds a little far fetched for me to comprehend. 

As Candy continued to talk, my thoughts again wandered to Beth. 

What did she want to talk about? 

We usually talked on Sundays, why was she asking to call outside of our scheduled time? 

The questions raced around in my mind, making me worry about what was going to happen once I called her. 

As we approached the call centre I went to check the time, but in my haste to get ready I had forgotten to put on my watch. 

“Candy, do you have the time?” 

I just hope that I’m not too late, and Beth is still at home. 

“It’s 9:45.”

Ok, that’s good. I still had time. 

With each step, my mind became more clear, more resolute. Whatever it was that she had to talk to me about, I could face it. As Candy and I entered the call centre, I thanked her and left to find an available phone. 

The call centre was just like any other public building: nondescript and drab. This particular building had been in the city for a while, but was recently outfitted with newer phone cubicles that allowed for more privacy, online booking, and the use of the city’s new Calling Card system. Needless to say, this area of town becomes quite busy after regular business hours. 

I entered my cubicle and tapped my card on the reader. The interface opened my profile and contact list, which I hurriedly scrolled through to find and dial Beth’s number. Once I found the profile I was looking for, I clicked to initiate the call. The phone rang for an achingly long time before she picked up. 

“Hey! Thanks for calling back!”  

“Hey, are you good? Is everything alright?”

She softly chuckled “Everything is fine, I was actually just wondering,” she paused for a moment, and my heart felt like it might burst from my chest, “instead of having just a phone call tomorrow, would you like to go out instead? Maybe for lunch or or a movie?”

Well, I hadn’t expected this to happen.

“Yes! Uh, I mean, yea of course, I’d love to!” 

“Awesome! I’ll call you later then?” 

“Sure!”

I really needed to get my phone fixed.
